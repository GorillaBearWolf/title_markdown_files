# Title Markdown Files

A simple Python script that accepts a folder path _(enter a period ( . ) for current folder)_ and renames all non-hidden Markdown files in the folder, removing dashes ( - ) and underscores ( _ ) and transforming the string into title case.

A test script is also included for validation.
